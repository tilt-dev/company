# Product Development


## Workflow
We have a process for figuring out what to build, when to build, and how to build. We strive for simplicity and transparency (this document) to help teams maximize collabortion and innovation speed. The process is lightweight, affording teams the room to work independently and with users directly. Teams have ownership of solving business problems and thus have the responsibility of achieving positive business outcomes.

The process is summarized in the image above as a linear workflow as a first-order approximation, as a process goal to aid collaboration. At the far left, we continually have conversations with customers and the community. These are synthesized into GitHub issues. Based on this feedback and our broader company goals and strategy, we maintain a backlog of high-level initiatives (primarily product changes). At some point, a given initiative is further fleshed out with scoped work and success criteria, before being implemented and shipped.
