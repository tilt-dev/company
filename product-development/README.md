# Product Development


## Workflow
We have a process for figuring out what to build, when to build, and how to build. We strive for simplicity and transparency (this document) to help teams maximize collabortion and innovation speed. The process is lightweight, affording teams the room to work independently and with users directly. Teams have ownership of solving business problems and thus have the responsibility of achieving positive business outcomes.

The process is summarized in the image above as a linear workflow as a first-order approximation, as a process goal to aid collaboration. At the far left, we continually have conversations with customers and the community. These are synthesized into GitHub issues. Based on this feedback and our broader company goals and strategy, we maintain a backlog of high-level initiatives (primarily product changes). At some point, a given initiative is further fleshed out with scoped work and success criteria, before being implemented and shipped.

### Defining High-level Business Initiatives
All Tilters are encouraged to collaborate in defining high-level business initiatives over time. This is an ongoing task without specific timelines. Victor is responsible for ensuring that the backlog of initiatives is continually full. There should be no shortage of initiatives, recorded as Clubhouse epics.

### Solving Business Problems
When a Tilt engineer is free, they should pick the next business initiative to work on. They may consider working with one or more other engineers together as a team. (A engineer should avoid working on multiple intiatives concurrently.) The team should initially focus on fleshing out the business intiative at the outset, including:
- Clearly articulating the business problem with tangible goals and success criteria.
- Defining a small scope of work. (If the initiative takes more than 2 weeks to build, it should probably be further subdivided.)

The team should design and implement solutions, evaluate results and collect feedback from users during the course of working on the initiative. There is no strict timebox for a given initiative, with the caveat that if an initiative is dragging beyond 2 weeks, the team may want to corrective action, such as reducing scope and defer remaining work to a future time. After the initiative is delivered, the team is disbanded, and individuals should find the next initiative to work on, with the next team. Engineers should self-organize and coordinate timelines when selecting initiatives to work on. (We prefer not to have a synced cadence of timelines.)
