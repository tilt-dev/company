# Product Development


## Workflow
We have a lightweight product develoment workflow that empowers teams to solve business problems, working directly with customers, and to be accountable for achieving positive business outcomes.

The workflow is summarized in the image above. At the far left, we continually have conversations with customers and the community. These are synthesized into GitHub issues. Based on this feedback and our broader company goals and strategy, we maintain a backlog of high-level initiatives as Clubhouse epics (primarily product changes). Over time, epics are further fleshed out with scoped work and success criteria, before being implemented and shipped.

### Defining High-level Business Initiatives (Epics)
All Tilters are encouraged to collaborate in defining high-level business initiatives (Clubhouse epics) over time. This is an ongoing task with no specific timelines. Victor is responsible for ensuring that the backlog of epics is continually full. There should be no shortage of epics.

### Incrementally Solving Business Problems
When a Tilt engineer is free, they should pick a high priority epic to work on. They may consider working with another engineer as a two-person team. Engineers should avoid working on multiple epics concurrently. 

The team should initially focus on fleshing out the epic at the outset, including:
- Clearly articulating the business problem with tangible goals and success criteria.
- Defining a small scope of work. The epic should not take more than 2 weeks to finish. If a solution takes more than 2 weeks, consider breaking it up into multiple epics.

The purpose of a single epic is **not** to completely solve a business problem. Rather, an epic should make incremental progress at addressing problem, adding incremental user value.

After the epic is completed, the team is disbanded, and individuals should find the next epic to work on, with the next team. Engineers should self-organize and coordinate timelines when selecting epics to work on.
