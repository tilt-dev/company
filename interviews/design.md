# Design Interviews

## Rubric

Loosely based on the Eng interview process and Product lead interview process

See https://tilt.dev/product_designer for role and responsibility description

Rubric:

A) Design-led Product Development

- User Research - Has multiple strategies for investigating and mapping out user
  needs. Can adjust tactics for both open-source randos and corporate partners.
- Thoughtfully Presents Information - Understands the ways that developers are
  inundated with data, most of which is noise. Experiments with different levels
  of hierarchy.
- Visual Fluency - Can fluently convert their ideas into visual artifacts that
  communicate purpose to both the eng team and the user.
- Basic Devtools Knowledge - Prior experience with tools for developers and
  existing conventions for how they display information.
- Autonomy - Ability to work independently. Can collect the information they
  need to move forward, and be flexible under uncertainty.

B) Ability to Learn and Teach

- Curiosity - Asks “why?” and seeks answers. If not familiar with Docker or
  Kubernetes, is able to ask the right questions and figure out what they are.
- Awareness - Recognizes when others require help, support, or feedback, and
  receptive when someone delivers critical feedback to them
- Empathy - Minimizes the desire to blame, and able to put themselves in a
user’s shoes
- Communication - Describing ideas, discussing approaches, presentations, status
updates 
- Collaboration - Able to work with one another effectively and resolve
disagreements 
- Perspective - Each new perspective we can add to the company helps us bridge
the gaps between ourselves and the world, and can expose us to ideas

The first set of values is derived from the job req.

The second set of values are from the Eng interview rubric, and speak to a
general attitude that we think is important to everyone doing product
development.

## Interview formats

Here are some interview formats we're trying. We might not use all these
interview formats on every candidate.

### A top-grading / job history interview

Go through your entire resume from bottom to top. The most valuable parts of top
grading are when we dig into the transition points (why did you leave X? Why did
you go to Y?), and what your coworkers thought of you (did your coworkers at X
give you feedback on areas you needed to improve?). We also try to press for
examples of conflict and how you resolved them.

This format is meant to get at collaboration, awareness, and empathy, but may
get at any of the other values.

### A problem-solving interview

We talk about a vague customer issue that we need to address (what is it, what
it isn’t, why we’re doing it, some high-level user stories). You ask clarifying
questions, then we discuss:

- They should suggest some possible user flows
- We ask about the trade-offs that those user flows make
- Let’s sketch out the interaction
- When showing the feature to end users, what kind of signals would you pay attention to?

This format is meant to get at visual fluency, thoughtful presentation of info,
devtools knowledge, and collaboration, but may get at any of the other values.

### Learning and Critique Interview

We’re flipping the script. We will run through a presentation on Tilt. You
critique it. There are a couple of different angles you should approach it from.

- We don’t expect you to understand everything in this presentation! What
  questions do you have? Can you ask questions to clarify your understanding?
- We do a lot of user research! What additional research would you do, based on
  what you heard here?
- We had a lot of discussion about how to present this! What did you think about
  how it conveys information? Would you have done it differently? What visuals
  or re-ordering could have helped?

This format is meant to get at awareness, curiosity, devtools knowledge, and
thoughtful presentation of info, but may get at any of the other values.

### A past project interview

Deep dive on a design problem that you’ve worked on in the past. It can be
anything, but try to pick something where the feature that you eventually
released was non-obvious and took multiple user conversations to get
right. Explain the process: how you collected the requirements, mapped them out,
explored options, and validated the results. Should take ~20 minutes to
present. It’s OK if it’s informal. It’s also OK if you use existing
artifacts/case studies from your portfolio. Afterwards we’ll ask follow-up
questions.

This format is meant to get at user research and communication, but may get at
any of the other values.
