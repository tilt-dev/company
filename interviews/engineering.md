# Engineering Interviews

## Rubric

Our engineering rubric is based on Medium’s [Engineering
Interview](https://medium.engineering/mediums-engineering-interview-process-b8d6b67927c4)
process. We’re evaluating people on a collection of values described in more
detail in Medium’s
[rubric](https://medium.engineering/engineering-interviews-grading-rubric-8b409bec021f).

### Ability to Build Software

- Problem Solving - Conceives multiple solutions to a problem and thinks through
  their trade-offs.
- Code Fluency - Can translate ideas into code.
- Autonomy - Can work independently and own their own decisions.
- Basic Computer Science Knowledge - Understands conventions of software and how
  programs fit together.
- System Design - Demonstrates an understanding of how to break a large problem
  into components and make reasonable decisions about how they interact.
- Resoluteness - Overcomes frustration and is not unduely discouraged by failed
  attempts.

### Ability to Learn and Teach

- Curiosity - Asks “why?” and seeks answers 
- Awareness - Recognizes when others require help, support, or feedback, and
  receptive when someone delivers critical feedback to them
- Empathy - Minimizes the desire to blame, and able to put themselves in a
  user’s shoes
- Communication - Describing ideas, discussing approaches, presentations, status
  updates
- Collaboration - Able to work with one another effectively and resolve
  disagreements
- Perspective - Each new perspective we can add to the company helps us bridge
  the gaps between ourselves and the world, and can expose us to ideas

We also consider a few values that are more specific to our stage at a company:

Goals - We’re focused on building devtools with a great user experience. Do the
candidate’s goals align well with ours? A candidate who is perfectly happy with
the git workflow today would not be a good fit.

Experimentation - We are going to be building many experiments. Many will
fail. We will pivot to others. Is the candidate comfortable with this type of
instability? A candidate who just wants to, say, focus on the scala compiler all
day would not be a good fit.

Invention - Can the candidate think outside the box of existing systems? A
candidate who slaps a cronjob on top of git and calls it a day would not be a
good fit.

## Interview formats

Here are some interview formats we've used in the past:

- A job history interview where we go through your entire resume
  from bottom to top, and understand the arc of your career. We particularly
  dig into the transition points (why did you leave X? Why did you go to Y?), and
  what your coworkers thought of you (did your coworkers at X give you
  feedback on areas you needed to improve?).

- A coding fluency interview where we ask you to solve a problem, and ask how
  you'd translate your approach into code. You have the choice of doing this
  entirely in-person or with a take-home component. If you choose the take-home,
  you should expect to spend 2 hours on it before the interview, then we'll use
  the in-person time to collaborate on your solution. We assess your ability to
  try different ideas and express them as code, not knowledge of specific
  algorithms.
  
- A system design interview where we ask you how you'd break down a product
  feature that can expand to include a lot of complexity: backend features,
  frontend features, and competing user needs. We assess your ability to analyze
  the problem, recognize multiple approaches, and explain trade-offs.

- A past project interview where we ask you to explain a past technical project.
  We want you to choose a project that you feel puts you in your best light, but
  we recommend you choose a project where you collaborated with others on
  something technically challenging. We assess your ability to communicate
  technical concepts and how you work.

- A product feedback interview where you walk through some task with Tilt. We
  discuss what problems you see and how you would change things. We
  assess your curiosity and ability to put yourself in the user's shoes.
