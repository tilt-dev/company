# Internships

Tilt partners with [HackNY](https://hackny.org/) to offer a summer engineering
internship.

As a small startup, our internship program looks different than interships at
more established companies.

## Goals

- An intern at Tilt is a full part of a small startup team.

- The intern should get the opportunity to meet everyone on the team and 
  learn about what they do day-to-day.

- Conversely, everyone on the team should have the opportunity to pair with the
  intern and help them grow. The ability to learn and teach is an
  important part of being an engineer.
  
## Non-Goals

- At some companies, a successful internship can turn into a full-time offer.
  At Tilt, this is a non-goal. Small startup hiring is highly contrained, and
  it's simply unlikely that our hiring needs will line up with intern hiring
  timelines. Tilt has never made a full-time offer to an intern. But we have
  used our networks to help them find their next job.
  
- Some companies try to hire interns for a particular skillset or short-term project.
  For example, they might hire an AI PhD for a predefined AI project. We don't need
  Tilt interns to have prior experience in Kubernetes, infra, or devtools.

## Corollaries

- We don't have a pool of side projects that are designated "intern"
  projects. Interns at Tilt will collaborate with other Tilters on our regular
  feature backlog. A full-time Tilt engineer will help the intern scope work to
  a realistic size.

- We don't expect interns to have worked with Kubernetes or multi-service development
  before they join. But we do expect interns to have some desire to learn Kubernetes
  and experiment with it.

## What We Look For

We use our normal [engineering rubric](engineering.md) to evaluate intern
candidates. But there are a few qualities we pay particular attention to in
interns:

- Prior job experience: This might be a previous internship, or a previous
  job. An internship at Tilt is not a good first internship.

- Prior project experience: This might be experience working with Go (or a
  Go-like language), or experience working in a microservice-based architecture.
  Having something familiar to anchor against can help with feeling overwhelmed,
  since the intern will be learning a lot in a short time!

- Autonomy/Resoluteness: A school project has a lot of structure (a syllabus,
  deadlines, clear instructions, known solutions, etc.).  An engineering project
  at a large company has less structure, but still might have multi-year
  roadmaps. At a small startup, you might not know what you're working on next
  month. This is not a good internship for a student who's looking for a lot of
  predictability. So we look for demonstrated ability to work independently and
  push through failed attempts.
  
- Curiosity/Collaboration: At Tilt, the intern is going to be exposed to dev
  environments of different partner companies. Knowing how to ask questions
  effectively and pair with other Tilters is key. If the intern tries to learn
  everything independently, they will burn out -- there is simply too much to learn
  in the time they're here.
  
## Interview Process

With HackNY fellows, we typically do two interviews:

- A half-hour informal chat with Nick. We mainly talk about what it's like to work
  at Tilt, and make sure the intern's expectations are aligned with reality.
  
- An hour-long technical interview with an engineer. This can be any one of the
  interviews from the [Engineering interview](engineering.md) doc.
