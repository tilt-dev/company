# Developer Advocate Interviews

## Rubric

See [the job listing](https://tilt.dev/advocate) for role and responsibility description.


Loosely based on the [Engineering Interview](engineering.md) process.

Our engineering rubric is based on [Medium’s Engineering
Interview](https://medium.engineering/mediums-engineering-interview-process-b8d6b67927c4)
process. We’re evaluating people on a collection of values described in more
detail in Medium’s
[rubric](https://medium.engineering/engineering-interviews-grading-rubric-8b409bec021f).



### Ability to Learn and Teach

- Curiosity - Asks “why?” and seeks answers 
- Awareness - Recognizes when others require help, support, or feedback, and
  receptive when someone delivers critical feedback to them
- Empathy - Minimizes the desire to blame, and able to put themselves in a
  user’s shoes
- Communication - Describing ideas, discussing approaches, presentations, status
  updates
- Collaboration - Able to work with one another effectively and resolve
  disagreements
- Perspective - Each new perspective we can add to the company helps us bridge
  the gaps between ourselves and the world, and can expose us to ideas


### Past Developer Advocacy Experience

- Familiarity with the Kubernetes community - Brings prior knowledge of the needs and concerns of the developers in the Kubernetes community. Has existing relationships they can draw on.
- Advocating for developers in our target audience - Has specific experience in strategies for advocating for microservice developers, what strategies work and which do not

The first set of values are from the engineering interview rubric. In some sense, we're
thinking of a developer advocate whose primary focus is on learning and teaching, and
who doesn't need to be assessed for building systems.

The other set of values are “bonus” things that help expand our team’s skill set.

## Interview Formats

Here are some interview formats we've used in the past for this role. We don't
always use the same interview formats. But we always use a variety of interview
styles in every panel.

### A job history interview

We go through your entire resume from bottom to top, and understand the arc of your career. We particularly dig into the transition points e.g. why did
you leave X, why did you go to Y? And what your coworkers thought of you e.g. did
your coworkers at X give you feedback on areas you needed to improve?
  
We dig into both relationships with end-users, and with the engineering team.

### A learning and teaching interview

We ask the candidate to explain a Kubernetes concept. It can be anything, but
they should try to pick something meaty that could take 20-30 minutes to
explain. (Some ideas: RBAC, CRDs.) Assume that we have used Kubernetes before but
only as a user. We haven't set up a cluster. Afterwards we ask follow up
questions.

The point of this interview is to assess the candidate's ability to teach,
communicate and empathize.

### A collaboration interview

We talk about a customer issue for which we’re building a new feature in Tilt to
address, roughly following structure of a product brief: what is it, what it
isn’t, why we’re doing it, some high-level user stories. 

The candidate asks
clarifying questions, then we discuss:

- Let’s think through how we should introduce this feature to prospective users.
- How should we approach documenting this feature?
- Given their knowledge of our general audience i.e. people in the Kubernetes
  community, are there things we should reconsider about the feature or its
  launch?
- When showing the feature to end users, what kind of signals would you pay
  attention to?

This format is meant to simulate an ad hoc collaborative work session. We look for
both their general expertise, but also their ability to give feedback constructively.

### Feedback on Tilt Setup and Documentation

Candidate gets homework to setup Tilt, either on a project they know, or one of
our demo projects (e.g. Servantes). Candidate should come in with feedback they
have as a user, focused on the areas they would advocate for. We generally expect it to
be around documentation, landing page, etc.
