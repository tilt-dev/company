# Interviews

## Philosophy

We want to be thoughtful about how we assess candidates. 

Too many people think that the key to an interview is finding a “magic
question.” We think that the real key is to be explicit about how we
assess answers. The questions are less interesting.

Lastly, we want interview formats that let candidates present themselves at
their best. We recognize that different people succeed in different
formats. Four coding interviews would select for people that are good at coding
interviews, but would not necessarily be good additions to our team. On the
other hand, inventing a new interview format for every candidate would make it
hard for us to assess candidates consistently. We try to be mindful of that
balance.

## General Process

We try to keep the general process the same for all roles.

This isn't a blood oath! We do tweak the process a bit from role to role.

### Candidate Screening

- Dan and Nick both talk to the candidate for a half-hour separately. 

- For the first chat, talk about the role, what we expect that role to
  be responsible for, and how that aligns with the candidate's background.
  
- For the second chat, probe a bit more about any specific concerns we
  have. This may involve a technical screen, depending on how necessary we think
  it is.
  
If both chats go well, ask them to come in for a full interview panel.

### Before the Interview

- Decide on a “Hiring Coordinator.” The hiring coordinator is responsible for all
  communications with the candidate (interview scheduling, rejection, etc).

- Create a private Slack channel called “#leads-CANDIDATE-NAME”. All people
  interviewing the candidate should be members of the channel, and limit
  discussion to the channel.
  
- Decide on a Rubric of values we want to assess on. Creating a rubric from
  scratch is a lot of effort. We try to borrow from published rubrics and adapt
  them to our values.

- Decide on interview formats and who will be conducting each interview. We
  typically do 3-4 interviews.
  
- Copy the Interview Form and fill it in with the Rubric values and interview format.

- Email the candidate a description of the interviews and action items for the interview (see below).

## After the Interview

- All interviewers should write down a summary of their feedback *before*
  discussing the candidate with other interviewers.
  
- Use the interview feedback form to help yourself organize thoughts about the
  candidate, rather than a formatted report to turn in to a separate committee.
  If you're not sure what to write, this [short guide](feedback.md) can help you
  determine the right amount of detail.
  
- The hiring coordinator should communicate the timeline for when we expect to make
  a decision.

- All interviewers should meet, share their feedback, and make an offer/no-offer
  decision.

- Dan and Nick should slot the candidate and agree on an offer based on the
  compensation spreadsheet.

- If yes, Dan (as CEO) should deliver the offer in a phone call to gauge
  reaction. If no, the hiring coordinator should send the rejection email.

### Interview Action Items

A common failure case is that the interviewee didn't prepare for the
interview. There are many ways this can break down. Maybe the interviewee didn't
read or understand the action items. Maybe the interviewer didn't communicate to
the hiring coordinator what they were expecting.

The exact text of any action items should be posted to the Slack channel.

It should look something like:

```
Action Items:
1. Think on what past project you want to talk about. We will spend one whole interview talking about it.
2. Decide if you want the code fluency interview entirely in-person or with a take-home component.
3. If you select the take-home, email it to us in advance of the interview.
```

## Specific Process

Every role should have

1. A job posting

2. A rubric of values that we're assessing

3. A set of interview formats to get at these values

Here's what this looks like for specific roles:

- [Engineering](engineering.md)
- [Design](design.md)
- [Internships](internships.md)
