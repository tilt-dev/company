# Operations Interviews

Rubric:

A) Ability to Learn and Teach

- Curiosity

- Awareness

- Empathy

- Communication

- Collaboration

B) Ability to Organize Chaos and Get Stuff Done

- Flexibility - Able to identify the best way to move a project forward, take on
  that role, then let go of that role when the project has completed.

- Project Management - Able to keep track of multiple overlapping projects and
  schedules. Open to adjusting the schedule as new information arises.

The first set of values are from the Eng interview rubric. At this point, I’m
treating them as overall culture values at a devtools company.

The other set of values are more specific to an operational role
at a startup where you're managing timelines and filling in gaps.

## Interview Formats

Here are some interview formats we're trying. We expect the exact process
and structure to change as we interview candidates and get a sense of
which questions give us interesting responses and which do not.

### A top-grading / job history interview

Go through their entire resume from bottom to top. The most valuable parts of
top grading are when we dig into the transition points (why did you leave X? Why
did you go to Y?), and what their coworkers thought of them (did your coworkers
at X give you feedback on areas you needed to improve?)

### A company process interview

We talk about a company process that we want to improve. We explain the
strengths and weaknesses of the current process, and what we want out of the
process is instead. The candidate asks clarifying questions, then we discuss:

- What a different process might look like.

- What the candidate would be responsible for.

- What others would be responsible for, and how the candidate would track things.

- What signals they would pay attention to

### Content Feedback

We present a piece of content that we want to publish but that has major
problems (it could be a blog post, a video, or something else). Then we discuss:

- What’s missing from this content?

- What’s not coming across?

- How much effort should we spend fixing it?

- How might we divide up the work?

- What polish would you try to add on your own?

This format is meant to simulate an ad hoc collaborative work session on either
marketing or devrel. We assess general flexibility and curiosity. (We don’t
expect specific insights on our product or our specific audience, but we DO
expect them to be able to ask questions when they don’t understand
something). We also listen for how well they can constructively give critical
feedback.
