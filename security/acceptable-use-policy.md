# Acceptable Use Policy

Our users trust us, and they expect us to protect the data and
resources they've shared with us. Part of how we'll uphold that trust is
through pre-established policies so we don't need to make key decisions
in critical moments.

Below, we explain the sections of our acceptable use policy: what each
protects against, why a user may care, and why we think each is
important. We don't mean for the Acceptable Use Policy to intimidate,
but we do aim for it to be clear.

## General Use and Ownership

This section explains policy around separating work activities from
personal activities as much as possible. Understand that the systems you
use for work, including a company-provided laptop, have a _much lower
expectation of privacy_ than systems you own. You may use your company
devices for reasonable personal use, but those devices are not yours
because:

- If the company is sued, all its devices are subject to discovery,
  which means opposing counsel will have access to your data.

- When we troubleshoot our systems, company administrators may have
  access to your data.

- We may terminate an employee, which may include giving another
  employee access to the terminated employees' devices and accounts.

- If we are breached, outside investigators will likely inspect all
  use of an account and/or device, no matter its purpose.

Please limit personal use of company-provided devices as much as
possible and remember that corporate devices are not your personal
property. Our policies are strict so that we do not have to make
judgment calls on a case-by-case basis in high-stress situations.

## Security and Proprietary Information

This section describes behaviors the company expects of you, including
password hygiene and the use of multi-factor authentication.

## Acceptable Use

The first part of this section details the consequences for malicious,
negligent, and/or delinquent behavior. Neither intentionally harm others
nor break laws.

The section's second part emphasizes that your employment by the company
does not make you one of the company's public representatives. Instead,
public communication and brand are controlled centrally at the company.
While email and social media are mentioned specifically, please be
conservative overall in how you represent yourself as an employee.

## Policy Compliance

This section details the information security team's role in measuring,
enforcing, and making exceptions to the policy and the potential
consequences, including termination, for policy violations.

# Acceptable Use Policy

1. Overview

---

Windmill Engineering's intentions for publishing an Acceptable Use Policy are not
to impose restrictions that are contrary to Windmill Engineering's established
culture of openness, trust and integrity. Instead, the team is committed
to protecting Windmill Engineering's employees, partners and the company from
illegal or damaging actions by individuals, either knowingly or
unknowingly.

Internet/Intranet/Extranet-related systems, including but not limited to
computer equipment, software, operating systems, storage media, network
accounts providing electronic mail, WWW browsing, and FTP, are the
property of Windmill Engineering. These systems are to be used for business
purposes in serving the interests of the company, and of our clients and
users in the course of normal operations.

Effective security is an organizational effort involving the
participation and support of every employee and affiliate who deals with
Windmill Engineering information and/or information systems. It is the
responsibility of every computer user to know these guidelines, and to
conduct their activities accordingly.

2. Purpose

---

The purpose of this policy is to outline the acceptable use of computer
equipment at Windmill Engineering. These rules are in place to protect the
employee and Windmill Engineering. Inappropriate use exposes Windmill Engineering to risks
including virus attacks, compromise of network systems and services, and
legal issues.

3. Scope

---

This policy applies to the use of information, electronic and computing
devices, and network resources to conduct business or interact with
internal networks and business systems, whether owned or leased by
Windmill Engineering, the employee, or a third party. All employees, contractors,
consultants, temporary, and other workers and its subsidiaries are
responsible for exercising good judgment regarding appropriate use of
information, electronic devices, and network resources in accordance
with policies and standards, and local laws and regulation. Exceptions
to this policy are documented in section 5.2

This policy applies to employees, contractors, consultants, temporaries,
and other workers at Windmill Engineering, including Windmill Engineering-affiliated
personnel employed with third parties. This policy applies to all
equipment that is owned or leased by Windmill Engineering.

4. Policy

### 4.3 Unacceptable Use

The following activities are, in general, prohibited. Employees may be
exempted from these restrictions during the course of their legitimate
job responsibilities (e.g., systems administration staff may have a need
to disable the network access of a host if that host is disrupting
production services).

Under no circumstances is an employee authorized to engage in any
activity that is illegal under local, state, federal or international
law while utilizing Windmill Engineering-owned resources.

The lists below are by no means exhaustive, but attempt to provide a
framework for activities which fall into the category of unacceptable
use.

**4.3.1** System and Network Activities: the following activities are
strictly prohibited, with no exceptions:

1.  Violations of the rights of any person or company protected by
    copyright, trade secret, patent or other intellectual property, or

    installation or distribution of "pirated" or other software products
    that are not appropriately licensed for use by the company.

2.  Unauthorized copying of copyrighted material including, but not
    limited to, digitization and distribution of photographs from
    magazines, books or other copyrighted sources, copyrighted music,
    and the installation of any copyrighted software for which the end
    user does not have an active license is strictly prohibited.

3.  Exporting software, technical information, encryption software or
    technology, in violation of international or regional export control
    laws, is illegal. The appropriate management should be consulted
    prior to export of any material that is in question.

    Security breaches include, but are not limited to, accessing data of
    which the employee is not an intended recipient or logging into a
    server or account that the employee is not expressly authorized to
    access, unless these duties are within the scope of regular duties.
    For purposes of this section, "disruption" includes, but is not
    limited to, network sniffing, ping floods, packet spoofing, denial
    of service, and forged routing information for malicious purposes.
    Windmill Engineering Security team members providing pre-planned penetration
    testing and vulnerability scans on corporate networks,
    infrastructure and end user devices are exempt from this due to the
    nature of their job duties.

10. Port scanning or security scanning is expressly prohibited unless
    the Security team is notified in advance. Windmill Engineering Security team
    members providing pre-planned penetration testing and vulnerability
    scans on corporate networks, infrastructure and end user devices are
    exempt from this due to the nature of their job duties.

11. Executing any form of network monitoring which will intercept data
    not intended for the employee's host, unless this activity is a part
    of the employee's normal job/duty. Windmill Engineering Security team members
    providing pre-planned penetration testing and vulnerability scans on
    corporate networks, infrastructure and end user devices are exempt
    from this due to the nature of their job duties.

12. Circumventing user authentication or security of any host, network
    or account. Windmill Engineering Security team members providing pre-planned
    penetration testing and vulnerability scans on corporate networks,
    infrastructure and end user devices are exempt from this due to the
    nature of their job duties.

13. Introducing honeypots, honeynets, or similar technology on the

16. Providing information about, or lists of, employees to parties
    outside Windmill Engineering.

**4.3.2** Email and Communication Activities: When using company
resources to access and use the Internet, users must realize they
represent the company. Whenever employees state an affiliation to the
company, they must also clearly indicate that "the opinions expressed
are my own and not necessarily those of the company." Questions may be
addressed to Windmill Engineering management.

1.  Sending unsolicited email messages, including the sending of "junk
    mail" or other advertising material to individuals who did not
    specifically request such material (email spam).

    behalf of, or to advertise, any service hosted by or connected via
    Windmill Engineering's network.

**4.3.3** Blogging and Social Media

1.  Blogging by employees, whether using Windmill Engineering's property and
    systems or personal computer systems, is also subject to the terms
    and restrictions set forth in this Policy. Limited and occasional
    use of Windmill Engineering's systems to engage in blogging is acceptable,
    provided that it is done in a professional and responsible manner,
    does not otherwise violate Windmill Engineering's policy, is not detrimental
    to Windmill Engineering's best interests, and does not interfere with an
    employee's regular work duties. Blogging from Windmill Engineering's systems
    is also subject to monitoring.

2.  Employees are prohibited from revealing any confidential or
    proprietary information, trade secrets or any other material covered
    by Windmill Engineering's Data Protection policy when engaged in blogging.

    discriminatory, disparaging, defamatory or harassing comments when
    blogging or otherwise engaging in any conduct prohibited by
    Windmill Engineering's Code of Conduct.

4.  Employees may also not attribute personal statements, opinions or
    beliefs to Windmill Engineering when engaged in blogging. If an employee is
    expressing his or her beliefs and/or opinions in blogs, the employee
    may not, expressly or implicitly, represent themselves as an
    employee or representative of Windmill Engineering. Employees assume any and
    all risk associated with blogging.

5.  Apart from following all laws pertaining to the handling and
    disclosure of copyrighted or export controlled materials,

    may also not be used in connection with any blogging activity.
