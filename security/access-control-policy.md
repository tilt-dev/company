# System Access & Authorization Control Policy

Each Windmill Engineering employee, contractor, and associate has limited access
to Windmill Engineering systems and applications. Access is always provisioned on
a minimum-necessary (least-privilege) basis.

## Employee Access to Windmill Engineering Systems

Access to Windmill Engineering systems and third party accounts owned by
Windmill Engineering will only be granted on a need-to-use basis, as defined by
the responsibilities of the position held and the duties of that
position.

Access control and management is divided into multiple phases of an
account lifecycle: creation, privilege management, authorization,
password management, audit, and revocation.

### Authorization: Role Based Access Control

- In most cases, Windmill Engineering employees are granted access to
  Windmill Engineering systems according to their role and/or team.

- The executive team and team managers are jointly responsible for
  maintaining a list of roles and associated access scope for team
  members.

- If a Windmill Engineering employee requires access outside of the standard
  for their role or team, either they or their managers may initiate
  an access request, following the policy outlined in "access
  requests" below.

### Creation: Access Requests

- Access requests for Windmill Engineering employees are made by
  employees or their managers.

- Access requests should be made to the Windmill Engineering employee or
  employees who manage the relevant resource(s).

- Those employees will not grant access unless they are satisfied the
  additional access is necessary for the grantee to complete a
  necessary business task.

- When granting access, employees will ensure grants are scoped to the
  minimum breadth and duration to complete the relevant business task.
  Root access will not be granted unless absolutely necessary to
  perform the job function.

- In addition, the employee(s) must accept the company's Acceptable Use Policy before access will be granted.

### Privilege Management

- Windmill Engineering's CTO will determine
  and maintain appropriate assignment of privilege within
  Windmill Engineering's production, development and test applications and
  environments.

- Windmill Engineering's CTO will determine
  and maintain appropriate assignment of privilege within
  Windmill Engineering's databases.

- Windmill Engineering's CTO will determine
  and maintain appropriate assignment within supporting
  infrastructure.

### Account Audit

- The responsible team will conduct quarterly audits
  of accounts, privileges and password management, and is required
  to document findings and changes.

### Revocation: Role Changes & Termination

- Managers must notify Windmill Engineering's
  CTO if an employee has been
  terminated or changes role.

- In the case of termination, the former employee's access is required
  to be revoked within reasonable timelines as defined by company
  procedural commitments in Vanta.

- In the case of a role change, the employee's access should be
  revised within reasonable timelines as defined by company procedural
  commitments in Vanta.

- In some cases, access will be revoked as a disciplinary measure for
  policy violation.

## Employee Authentication to Windmill Engineering Systems

### Authentication

Each Windmill Engineering employee has a unique user ID and password that
identifies them as the user of a Windmill Engineering IT asset or application.
All assets, applications and vetted third party platforms may be
required to have two-factor authentication configured.

### Password, Key, and Certificate Management

As specified in the Acceptable Use Policy and Password Policy,
Windmill Engineering employees must use complex passwords and multi-factor
authentication for all Windmill Engineering-related accounts. User passwords must
conform with the restrictions set forward in the Windmill Engineering Password
Policy. Please see Acceptable Use Policy and Password Policy for further
details and guidance.

Windmill Engineering's CTO is responsible for issuing and revoking SSH keys in all environments.

Windmill Engineering's CTO is responsible for issuing, renewing, and revoking public web and internal SSL certificates.

### Customer Data

Employees that require access to customer data must have an individual
account. This account, as well as actions performed with it, will be
subject to additional monitoring at the discretion of the management
team and subject to applicable regulations and third-party agreements.

At a minimum, employees with access to customer data can expect that their
actions in customer-data systems (e.g. an internal admin tool) will be
logged, with the logs stored centrally for at least 90 days.

## Guest Access to Windmill Engineering Systems

Occasionally, guests will have a legitimate business need for access to
the corporate network. When such need is demonstrated, temporary guest
access to company systems is permitted. This access, however, must be
severely restricted to only those resources that the guest needs at that
time, and disabled when the guest's work is completed.

## Guest Wireless Use

Windmill Engineering's production systems are not accessible directly over
wireless channels, and connecting to the company guest wireless network
should grant no extra privileges or access to company systems.

All employees have access to the networking equipment that is used by
the Windmill Engineering office network. It is each employee's responsibility to
ensure that the equipment is not tampered with.

## Disciplinary Action

Employees who violate this policy may face disciplinary consequences in
proportion to their violation. Windmill Engineering management will determine how
serious an employee's offense is and take the appropriate action:

- For minor violations, employees may only receive verbal reprimands.

- For more serious violations that lead to security incidents,
  employees may face severe disciplinary actions up to and including
  termination.

- Windmill Engineering employees will not be disciplined for surfacing
  deficiencies or misconfigurations that contradict this policy.

## Responsibility

Each Windmill Engineering employee is responsible for surfacing technical
misconfigurations and deficiencies to the CTO for immediate resolution.

The CTO of Windmill Engineering is responsible for ensuring
this policy is followed.
