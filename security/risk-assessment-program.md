# Risk Assessment & Management Program

Windmill Engineering (the company behind Tilt)'s Risk Assessment principles,
policies, procedures and methodology describes what systems Windmill Engineering
has in place to identify new business and technical risks and how often those
risks are mitigated.

## Principles

Windmill Engineering is proactive in its approach to risk management, balances
the cost of managing risk with anticipated benefits, and undertakes
contingency planning in the event that critical risks are realized.

Windmill Engineering has the primary duty to ensure the security of
critical systems and user data. A duty to ensure a secure, available
infrastructure requires Windmill Engineering to identify and manage risks.

Windmill Engineering believes that effective risk management involves:

1.  A commitment to the security of Windmill Engineering infrastructure
    and services from senior management;

2.  The involvement, cooperation and insight of all Windmill Engineering staff;

3.  A commitment to initiating risk assessments, starting with discovery
    and identification of risks;

4.  A commitment to the thorough analysis of identified risks;

5.  A commitment to a strategy for treatment of identified risks;

6.  A commitment to communicate all identified risks to the company;

7.  A commitment to encourage the reporting of risks and threat vectors
    from all Windmill Engineering staff.

Windmill Engineering believes that the following events can trigger a risk
assessment to occur:

1.  A significant and major change to existing infrastructure, product
    or business practices;

2.  A significant amount of time (e.g. a year) having passed since the
    last risk assessment.

Risk assessments can be as high level or detailed to a specific
organizational or technical change as Windmill Engineering stakeholders and
technologists see fit.

## Scope

This Risk Assessment & Management program and policy applies to all
systems and data on the Windmill Engineering network, owned by Windmill Engineering or its
customers, or operated on behalf of the organization.

Risk assessments should evaluate infrastructure such as computer
infrastructure containing networks, instances, databases, systems,
storage, and services. Windmill Engineering risk assessments will also include an
analysis of business practices, procedures, and physical office spaces
as needed.

Risk assessments for vendors are covered under Windmill Engineering's Vendor
Management Program, which includes a thorough risk assessment targeted
at a vendor's security, business practices, legal commitments and
insurance postures.

## Definitions

### Risk

Risk is the probability that a harmful consequence may result when
exposed to a hazard.

Risk is characterized and rated by considering two factors:

1.  Probability or likelihood (L) of occurrence; and

2.  Consequence (C) of occurrence.

This is expressed as R (risk) = L (likelihood) x C (consequence).

### Threat

A potential incident or activity which may be deliberate, accidental, or
caused by nature which may cause physical harm to a person or financial
harm to an organization.

### Likelihood

Likelihood is a qualitative description of probability or frequency. The
likelihood of occurrence is a weighted risk factor based on an analysis
of the probability that a given threat is capable of exploiting a given
vulnerability (or set of vulnerabilities). The likelihood risk factor
combines an estimate of the likelihood that the threat event will be
initiated with an estimate of the likelihood of impact (i.e., the
likelihood that the threat event results in adverse impacts).

### Consequence

Consequence is the outcome of an event and is a loss, disadvantage, or
gain. There are a range of possible outcomes associated with an event.
Consequence and impact are used interchangeably. The level of impact
from a threat event is the magnitude of harm that can be expected to
result from the consequences of unauthorized disclosure of information,
unauthorized modification of information, unauthorized destruction of
information, or loss of information or information system availability.

### Risk Assessment

A risk assessment is the process of evaluating and comparing a level of
risk against predetermined acceptable levels of risk. It is an
examination of all possible risks along with implemented and
non-implemented solutions to reduce, eliminate, or manage the risks.

### Risk Management

Risk management is the application of a management program that
addresses organizational and technical risk. This management program
includes identification, analysis, treatment, and monitoring.

### Risk Owner

A risk owner is the person responsible for managing an individual risk.
The risk owner is typically the person directly responsible for the
strategy, activity, or function that relates to that risk.

## Risk Assessment & Management Policy

This risk assessment policy specifies how and when risk assessments will
be done and who will be responsible for conducting risk assessments and
implementing solutions to address any risk assessment findings.

It is the responsibility of all Windmill Engineering staff to identify, analyse,
evaluate, monitor, and communicate risks associated with any activity,
technology, function, or process within their relevant scope of
responsibility and authority. Staff identifying potential risks or
vulnerabilities are to report them to internal staff and/or external parties.

Overall, the execution, development, and implementation of risk
assessments and remediation programs is the joint responsibility of
Windmill Engineering's CTO and the department
or individuals responsible for the surface area being assessed. All
staff are expected to cooperate fully with any risk assessment being
conducted on systems and procedures for which they are responsible.
Staff are further expected to work with the risk assessment project lead
in the development of a remediation plan for each risk assessment
performed.

- Windmill Engineering performs at least one risk assessment, at a minimum,
  every one year by the CTO and internal staff.

- A risk assessment should be done or reviewed on critical systems and
  applications no less than every two years.

- Risk assessments may be used to assess all risks to the
  organization.

- All staff involved with a risk assessment must fully cooperate with
  the risk assessment project lead in conducting the assessment and
  developing a remediation strategy.

- Any staff members or external consultants who perform any
  Windmill Engineering risk assessments are required to be familiar with
  computer technology and computer security in particular. The risk
  assessment project leader should be the security officer or a staff
  member designated by the security officer to conduct the risk
  assessment.

- Risk assessment deliverables include a risk assessment report with a
  risk reduction action plan to manage or mitigate any unacceptable
  risks. The action plan may be included with the risk assessment
  report, or separately. The action plan will be an plan for
  implementing additional controls and solutions to mitigate or manage
  the risk. The action plan may define participants and actions to be
  taken during the implementation of the action plan.

- The risk assessment process and methodology will be updated as
  required due to results of audits and incidents.

- All identified vulnerabilities will be assessed for impact and
  criticality. Vulnerabilities must be remediated as soon as possible
  as mandated by the Windmill Engineering Vulnerability and Patch Management
  Program.

## Risk Assessment Process

Windmill Engineering risk assessment methodology is based off [_NIST Special
Publication 800-30 Revision 1 - Guide for Conducting Risk
Assessments_](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/legacy/sp/nistspecialpublication800-30r1.pdf).

- Management defines the scope of risk assessment and creates the risk
  assessment team with a point person to guide the process (risk
  assessment project lead).

- If risk assessment procedures are not defined, the team should
  define them. The proper time and method of communicating the
  selected risk treatment options to the affected IT and business
  management should be included.

- Evaluate the system - Determine if the system is critical to the
  organization's business processes and determine the data
  classification and security needs of the data on the system
  according to the Windmill Engineering Data Classification Policy, considering
  security needs.

- List the threats - List possible threat sources such as an
  exploitation of a vulnerability.

- Identify vulnerabilities.

- Evaluate potential security controls already in place to assess if
  they adequately address the risk.

- Identify probability of exploitation. Additional security controls
  may need to be in place before the probability of exploitation is
  lowered.

- Quantify damage (impact) - Categorize the damage and possibly place
  a dollar amount on the damage where possible. This will help when
  looking at cost of controls to reduce the risk.

- Determine risk level - Use likelihood times impact to quantify the
  amount of risk.

- Evaluate and recommend controls to reduce or eliminate risk -
  Identify existing controls and those that may further reduce
  probabilities or mitigate specific vulnerabilities. List specific
  threats and vulnerabilities for the system to help identify
  mitigating controls.

- Create the risk assessment report.

- Communicate the selected risk treatment options to the affected IT
  and business management and staff.

- Take recommended risk mitigation actions. Record such actions as
  changes per the Windmill Engineering Change Management program.

- Monitor the effectiveness of the risk mitigation actions and
  document the results.

## Risk Mitigation Standards

### Acceptable Risks

When the probability of threat materialization times maximum damage
amount is less than \$1000 annually, the risk is acceptable. For higher
amounts, on a yearly basis, acceptance of the risk will depend on the
cost of implementing measures to reduce the risk. If the risk cannot be
reduced and the amount per year is greater than \$50,000, the risk
should be transferred by purchasing insurance.

### Risk Mitigation

Options for mitigating risk shall include the following possibilities:

- Reducing the chance of an occurrence of an event

- Reducing the damage due to occurrence

- Avoiding the risk

- Transferring the risk by taking an action such as purchasing
  insurance

Some guidelines and standards applicable to Windmill Engineering:

- Costs of implementing each control are considered and compared to
  the benefits, pecuniary and non-pecuniary, of implementing each
  control.

- Cost and benefit analysis is done to evaluate proposed controls
  versus risks. When the controls are evaluated, the benefits, costs,
  and cost savings of applying the controls both individually and in
  combination should be determined. Performance measures for
  determining the effectiveness of the new controls are created.

- Risks shall be ranked, and controls are selected, and a plan created
  to implement the controls. Responsibilities for implementing the
  controls are determined and communicated. Budgeting and schedules
  are set and the expected outcomes from mitigating the risks with the
  controls are documented. Residual risk after full implementation is
  considered.

- Decisions regarding residual risk are made. Specifically, whether to
  accept the risk, transfer the risk, or take other action, including
  adding additional controls.

- Safeguard options for addressing high risk scenarios must be
  considered and utilized appropriately while the extent of risk
  reduction and benefits are considered. Cost and benefit analysis is
  done to evaluate safeguard options.

- If the cost of safeguard options or recommended risk controls is
  greater than the available budget, the options and controls are
  prioritized to reduce as much risk as possible within the budget.

- When the risk assessment report is completed, results shall be
  communicated to the affected IT and business management and staff.

## Non-Compliance

Since risk assessments are an important part of protecting data and
systems for Windmill Engineering, employees that purposely violate this policy
may be subject to disciplinary action up to and including denial of
access, legal penalties, and/or dismissal. Any employee aware of any
violation of this policy is required to report it to their supervisor or
other authorized representative.

## Responsibility

The CTO of Windmill Engineering is responsible for
communicating detected risks and remediation steps needed to the
appropriate staff for resolution. Those staff members are then
responsible for resolving detected risks in a timely manner, guided by
the severity of the detected risk.
