# Product Principles

## Usability over documentation
We believe that Tilt should be usable without reading a separate manual. We strive to design usable interfaces, even for complex features with powerful functionality, without relying on subsequent documentation as a crutch for poor design. We prefer to use our [documentation](https://docs.tilt.dev/) to provide context on broad features, walkthroughs, and API details.
