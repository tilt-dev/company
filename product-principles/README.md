# Product Principles

As we scale Tilt the company and the product, we will explore how to build a product that best serves our users. These product prinicples help align Tilters and the open source community to build Tilt in a coherent fashion, also allowing for distributed decision making to ensure we can ship quickly. We expect these product principles themselves to evolve over time, so this is always a work in progress.

## Usability over documentation
We believe that Tilt should be usable without reading a separate manual. We strive to design usable interfaces, even for complex features with powerful functionality, without relying on subsequent documentation as a crutch for poor design. We prefer to use our [documentation](https://docs.tilt.dev/) to provide context on broad features, walkthroughs, and API details.

## Declarative over imperative
Inspired by modern container orchestration like Kubernetes, Tilt is designed with a declarative interface in mind.
