## Bug

We define a bug as any experience that breaks the _intended_ functionality of a user experience in [Tilt](https://docs.tilt.dev/), including [Tilt Cloud](https://cloud.tilt.dev/). In particular, we may have shipped a feature that failed to meet a certain user's expectation, but that may not necessarily qualify as a bug. In this case, we may should nonetheless track the user problem as a non-bug to improve Tilt.

We should express our intentions through [documentating Tilt functionality](https://docs.tilt.dev/) exhaustively, to better support users and manage their expectations.

Non-user facing problems are not classified as bugs.
