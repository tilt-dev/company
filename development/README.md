# Development

## Bugs

### Definition
We define a bug as any experience that breaks the _intended_ functionality of a user experience in [Tilt](https://docs.tilt.dev/), including [Tilt Cloud](https://cloud.tilt.dev/). In particular, we may have shipped a feature that failed to meet a certain user's expectation, but that may not necessarily qualify as a bug. In this case, we may should nonetheless track the user problem as a non-bug to improve Tilt.

We should express our intentions through [documentating Tilt functionality](https://docs.tilt.dev/) exhaustively, to better support users and manage their expectations.

Non-user facing problems are not classified as bugs.

### All bugs
All known open bugs should be listed in the [Bugs Clubhouse space](https://app.clubhouse.io/windmill/stories/space/4729/bugs). Some bugs are also listed in [GitHub issues](https://github.com/windmilleng/tilt/labels/bug). But these should be a subset of the entire set of open bugs in the Clubhouse space.

### Fix a bug at anytime
We believe in shipping a quality experience for both Tilt and Tilt Cloud. So Tilters are encouraged to use their own judgment in picking up a bug to fix at anytime, if they think it's the best use of their time at that moment, ahead of other priorities. Nobody should ever need experience to fix a bug.

### Exterminator assigns bugs
The [Exterminator](../user-support/README.md) is responsible triaging user support requests, including bugs. The Exterminator may fix a bug themself, or assign another Tilter to fix, coordinating appropriate people and circumstances.

### Assign yourself a bug
Tilters should regularly fix bugs. A good rule of thumb is to fix two bugs after you have finished working on an [epic](../product-development/README.md#picking-an-epic-to-work-on), whether as the DRI or a collaborator, before moving on to the next epic.

### Pick a high priority bug
When picking a bug to work on, Tilters are encouraged to pick a high priority bug that they can finish in a sensible time period for that bug. The [Bugs Clubhouse space](https://app.clubhouse.io/windmill/stories/space/4729/bugs) has higher priority bugs toward the top of columns.
