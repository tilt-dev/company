## Goals

### To Make Hard Things Safe to Try

#### What This Means

- At Tilt, we're building something new. We need to be able to try new ideas,
  even if we don't have 100% certainty that an idea will work.
  
- We should be able to celebrate good ideas that fail.
  If we never try an idea that fails, we have been too cautious.
  
- Tilters should be empowered to try ideas they feel strongly about, even if
  other people on the team disagree. Consensus is a bad way to make decisions,
  and we shouldn't require consensus on an idea to move forward.

#### What This Doesn't Mean

- Facebook used to have the slogan "Move Fast and Break Things." We shouldn't
  try things without considering any consequences at all.

### To Pool Everyone's Expertise

#### What This Means

- At Tilt, everyone has different perspectives. We need everyone's perspective to succeed.

- Everyone needs to feel safe to share their expertise.

- When we don't know something, either we need to be able to hire for it,
  or empower people to go learn it and bring back what they learned.

#### What This Doesn't Mean

- We want people to share ideas. But if the owner of a project doesn't use that
  idea, that's ok. That doesn't mean the sharer was wrong for sharing it.

- We shouldn't weigh all perspectives equally in all situations. e.g., if we're
  estimating a design task, we wouldn't ask the whole team to estimate it and
  average the results.

### To Understand Decisions

#### What This Means

- When Tilters read something (e.g., a Clubhouse epic) or leave a meeting, they
  should understand what the next steps are.

- When we look back at previous decisions, we should be able to figure out
  what our state of mind was when we made that decision and why we made it.

#### What This Doesn't Mean

- We don't expect everyone to agree with every decision - either for high-level
  decisions ("Why are we building Tilt?") or low-level ones ("Why does the logo
  use this shade of green?") - or even to be informed about every decision.
  
## Meetings

We borrow our meeting structure from Holacracy.

Eng Coach Jean Hsu has written [a great
article](https://medium.com/@jean/meetings-93446941a52a) on the goals of
Holacracy's meeting format.

### Roles

#### Lead

The lead is the “default” decision maker, unless they delegate it.

#### Facilitator

The facilitator runs the process. The facilitator should not be the lead. If a
discussion diverges from the tension currently being addressed, the facilitator
should bring them back on-task. This may mean interrupting people. The
facilitator is the only person who may interrupt others.

#### Secretary

The secretary records tensions and actions. The secretary should not be the
facilitator. The secretary is also responsible for other meeting logistics like
scheduling and booking rooms.

The secretary should not take general “meeting notes.” Everything that the
secretary writes down is a deliberate part of the process that the participants
of the meeting should dictate.

### Phases

#### Check-in

Each person should share their current status. Are you focused? Tired? Hungry? Facilitator determines order.

This is a no-reaction round. You may only talk if it's your turn. The
facilitator should strictly enforce this, saying “no cross-talk” if anyone else
speaks.

#### Review

The secretary projects the outputs of the previous meeting. The facilitator
steps through each action and asks for a brief status update. If more discussion
is needed, the facilitator should ask the secretary to record a tension for the
tensions phase.

#### Tensions

The facilitator calls on each person in order. Each person says a one or two
word tension, which is anything that is bothering them. The secretary adds it to
the list of tensions. The agenda building continues until everyone passes.

At any time, anyone may ask the secretary to add a new tension to the list.

The facilitator is allowed to choose tension order, but usually moves
top-to-bottom. The owner of the tension explains it. The role of everyone else
in the meeting is to help resolve the tension. If a tension requires an action
outside the meeting, the secretary should write it down.

Often, one tension will trigger other tensions. The facilitator should keep the
discussion centered on the original tension, and add new tensions to the agenda.

The meeting may not move to a new tension until the owner says that their
tension is resolved. Tension processing continues until all tensions are
resolved.

#### Check-out

During check-out, each person reflects on how the meeting went. Like check-in,
this is a no-reaction round.

## Written Communication

### Clubhouse

We use Clubhouse as the main system of record for:
- Writing up ideas for product features
- Leaving feedback on existing ideas
- Documenting next steps to move a product feature forward

If you want to discuss an idea (e.g. new or existing product feature, update a marketing page), comment on or create a new story/epic in Clubhouse. @-mention specific individuals and ask them specific questions. See [Product Development](../product-development/README.md).

Ensure your [Clubhouse notifications](https://help.clubhouse.io/hc/en-us/sections/201543416-Notifications) are properly configured.

### GitHub

We use GitHub as the main system of record for:
- Code review and low-level discussion of changes
- Processes we use at Tilt (in repos like [this one](https://github.com/tilt-dev/company))
- Public-facing bugs and feature requests

If you want to discuss a process change, consider the smallest reasonable
change and create a GitHub PR in this repo as a proposal. @-mention and assign
specific individuals for review.

### When Clubhouse and GitHub Fail:

- If you are having difficulty understanding each other over Clubhouse and/or
  GitHub, consider scheduling a meeting with a specific agenda to further
  discuss. But prefer starting with async communications first.

- Slack is an async tool. Don't expect people to respond immediately. Don't feel
  pressured to respond immediately.
