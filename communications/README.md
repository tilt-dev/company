# Communications

## Async written

- If you want to discuss an idea (e.g. new or existing product feature, update a marketing page), comment on or create a new story/epic in Clubhouse. @-mention specific individuals and ask them specific questions. See [Product Development](../product-development/README.md).
- Ensure your [Clubhouse notifications](https://help.clubhouse.io/hc/en-us/sections/201543416-Notifications) are properly configured. Respond to Tilters within a few days with an answer, or at least say you don't have time currently to do so.
- If you want to discuss a process change, consider the smallest reasonable change and create a GitHub PR in this repo as a proposal. @-mention and assign specific individuals for review.
- Only when you have exhausted discussions in Clubhouse and/or GitHub, consider scheduling a meeting with a clear agenda to determine next steps.
- Slack is an async tool. Don't expect people to respond immediately. Don't feel pressured to respond immediately.
