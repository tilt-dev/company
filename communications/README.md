# Communications

Tilt may currently be a relatively small company (less than 10 people as of mid 2020). But at even this small scale, communications needs to be effective for us to remain an operationally efficient organization, whereby Tilters can get the information to do their job well, and collaborate effectively with other Tilters, and with parties external to Tilt (such as customers, partners, and the open source community). This only becomes more critical as we grow the number of Tilters, and the number of external individuals we communicate with regularly.

## Async written first

Async written communications (Clubhouse, GitHub issues, Slack, email) is preferred over synched communications (video call meeting).

- Written communications can be easily reproduced, shared, linked to, searched for, and organized. This is critical for Tilt where we have many ideas generated on a daily basis.
- More people can participate in an async conversation, because they don't have to be in the same video call meeting, especially for folks in different time zones.
- A given person can participate in more conversations since they can chime in on their own schedule, rather than a pre-arranged meeting time.
- Future people can "participate" in old conversations by reading them and reviving them. I.e old conversations are automatically saved and documented for posterity. It is hard to record a video call and even harder for future people to watch them and extract relevant information. This is critical since many ideas in a startup like Tilt are based on market timing. Great conversations today may not result in shippable changes now, but future people may want to review past ideas nonetheless.
- Written ideas can be easily sliced and re-organized (especially with an idea management system like Clubhouse). Tilt is a complicated product and business. We need to constantly re-organize ideas. Written artifacts makes this possible.
- Async communications allows people to be more thoughtful in their responses. You are not pressured to respond immediately. You can take your time to craft a clear articulation of your thoughts, helping to move the conversation forward in a meaningful way.
- Async communications is more specific and self-documenting. It forces you to communicate more clearly.
- Some conversations are harder to have over written communications. Tilters should first try async by default, but quickly transition to a synced conversation (scheduled or ad-hoc video call meeting) as necessary.
