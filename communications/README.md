# Communications

Tilt may currently be a relatively small company (less than 10 people as of mid 2020). But at even this small scale, communications needs to be effective for us to remain an operationally efficient organization, whereby Tilters can get the information to do their job well, and collaborate effectively with other Tilters, and with parties external to Tilt (such as customers, partners, and the open source community). This only becomes more critical as we grow the number of Tilters, and the number of external individuals we communicate with regularly.

## Async written first

Async written communications (Clubhouse, GitHub issues, Slack, email) is preferred over synched communications (video call meeting).

- Written communications can be easily reproduced, shared, linked to, searched for, and organized. This is critical for Tilt where we have many ideas generated on a daily basis.
- More people can participate in an async conversation, because they don't have to be in the same video call meeting, especially for folks in different time zones.
