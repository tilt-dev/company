# Monthly Donations

Every month Windmill donates $100 per Tilter toward an organization that is working to make tech less toxic. The goal of these donations is twofold: to do our part to make our industry better, and [to signal to the world (and potential candidates) what kind of culture we want to build at Windmill](https://twitter.com/dbentley/status/1196853652444499968).

## Donation Deputy

If you have been designated Donation Deputy for the month, do the following in the specified order:

- Create a Clubhouse story with [this template](), filling out the fields, and in particular, proposing a candidate donation organization.
- Share the story with other Tilters, discussing the proposal. Consider pinging people in the story, in Slack, or discussing it during a company meeting.
- Get Nick and/or Dan B to indicate their final approval in the story with a comment.
- Create a PR to update this page, updating the Donation Log per the existing format. The PR should also include a nominated Tilter as Donation Deputy for the next month.
- @-mention the proposed Tilter and get them to approve the PR, indicating their acceptance of the nomination.
- Merge the PR, designating the proposted Tilter as the Donation Deputy for the next month. Remind them to follow this proces.
