# Monthly Donations

Every month Windmill donates $100 per Tilter toward an organization that is working to make tech less toxic. The goal of these donations is twofold: to do our part to make our industry better, and [to signal to the world (and potential candidates) what kind of culture we want to build at Windmill](https://twitter.com/dbentley/status/1196853652444499968).

Each month, one Tilter is designated as the Donation Deputy. They are responsible for proposing an organization to donate to (either via email or in Planning); the team then discusses the organization and confirms that we want to give to them.

The Donation Deputy is also responsible for coordinating the logistics of the donation (i.e. making sure it actually happens), and tweeting about it using the [@tilt_dev](https://twitter.com/tilt_dev) account. (Password in 1Password.) The Donation Deputy role is rotated between all Tilters. When the Donation Deputy for the month is assigned, the donation should be [tracked in a Clubhouse ticket](https://app.clubhouse.io/windmill/stories/new?template_id=5e6a6244-cc45-4cd2-a3ba-8ac4139a692a) to make sure it gets done.

The donation should be made with the corporate card. (Ask Nick/Dan to make the donation if you don't have access to the corporate card.)

Each new donation should be recorded in this document so that we have a record going forward.
