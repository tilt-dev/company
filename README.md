# What is this?
This is the Tilt company handbook. It documents _how_ we operate at Tilt. It is inspired by other companies' public handbooks:

- [Aula](https://www.notion.so/The-Aula-Brain-4da091a8797840108311d99815b3b36f)
- [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/handbook) - [GitHub repo](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook)
- [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/) - [GitLab repo](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/tree/master/source/handbook)

The actual work (e.g. product changes) that we plan and execute is tracked in [Clubhouse](https://app.clubhouse.io/windmill).

# How do I use it?

Tilters should know and follow the processes outlined here as much as possible. It is the source of truth of how we try to act and expect others to act. We recognize that there's a lot of content and people may not be caught up all the time. If you see a fellow Tilter not following a documented process, send them a kind reminder, linking them to the specific section.

Consider [watching this repo](https://help.github.com/en/github/receiving-notifications-about-activity-on-github/watching-and-unwatching-repositories) to get notifications of changes.

# How do I change it?

If you think a given process can be improved, suggest a change in this handbook by creating a PR. Invite other Tilters to discuss the change to get buy-in. As with any other PR, if it is non-trivial, include in the PR's description a statement of the problem the PR is attempting to solve.

We currently don't have a strict approval process, so use your personal judgement to decide who you should ask for review, and when a PR should be merged. For example, if you are correcting an obvious typo, you can probably commit directly to `master` without even creating a PR. But if you are proposing a change to vacation policy, you probably need to get approval from Dan B.

Once a PR is merged, the process is officially changed and Tilters should [abide by the new process](#how-do-i-use-it). Consider sharing the change broadly afterward so everyone knows.
