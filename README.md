# What is this?
This is the Tilt company handbook. It documents _how_ we operate at Tilt. It is inspired by other companies' public handbooks:

- [Aula](https://www.notion.so/The-Aula-Brain-4da091a8797840108311d99815b3b36f)
- [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/) - [GitLab repo](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/tree/master/source/handbook)

The actual work (e.g. product changes) that we plan and execute is tracked in [Clubhouse](https://app.clubhouse.io/windmill).

# How do I use it?

Tilters should know and follow the processes outlined here as much as possible. It is the source of truth of how we try to act and expect others to act. We recognize that there's a lot of content and people may not be caught up all the time. If you see a fellow Tilter not following a documented process, send them a kind reminder, linking them to the specific section.

Consider [watching this repo](https://help.github.com/en/github/receiving-notifications-about-activity-on-github/watching-and-unwatching-repositories) to get notifications of changes.

# How do I change it?

For simple changes or obvious typos, you can commit directly to master
without creating a PR.

If you want to propose a new policy or update an existing one, that policy
should have an owner. We borrow our OWNERS format from [the Kubernetes owner
format](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/guide/owners.md)
but use it more informally.

The OWNERS doc should express who has the ultimate call on changes
to the policy, and who should keep it up to date. At times, a small subteam may
maintain a policy together.

Anyone at Tilt may propose changes to the policies and discuss them with other
Tilters. But the responsible OWNERS have the final call.
