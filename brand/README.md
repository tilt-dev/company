# Brand

Tilt is a young company. [Tilt](https://tilt.dev/) and [Tilt
Cloud](https://cloud.tilt.dev/) are still very early in their product
lifecycle. As such, Tilt's brand is still maturing. And so we're using this
place to collect various brand elements as we grow.

## Names

Tilt is both the product and the company.

When the name "Tilt" is ambiguous (like in SEO), we prefer "Tilt Dev".

### Inventing new names

Tilt is a [Don Quixote reference](https://docs.tilt.dev/product_faq.html#why-did-you-call-it-tilt).

We like puns. Most of our product names tend to be puns on Don Quixote or puns on other products in the space.

- [ctlptl](https://ctlptl.dev/)
- [servantes](https://github.com/tilt-dev/servantes)

### Tilt Cloud

Tilt Cloud is two words, not one CamelCase word. One word CamelCase is more prevalent when the second word isn't descriptive, like GitHub or GitLab.

### Domain

We use `tilt.dev` since we think [`.dev` is better than `.io`](https://medium.com/windmill-engineering/dev-is-a-better-io-why-we-moved-to-tilt-dev-9fc8321693d3).

## Design

We use Figma for all designs. 

The [Figma Brand project](https://www.figma.com/files/project/326392/Brand) is the source of truth
for all design assets (colors, icons, logos, etc).

## Slides

The [Tilt Deck
Template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Fn7qddPuKAazRXPntG2MaYYbkWePP5I0QXgDWywWOqk/edit#slide=id.p)
contains a slide template that we use for internal and external presentations.
