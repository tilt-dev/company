# Brand

Tilt is a young company. [Tilt](https://docs.tilt.dev/) and [Tilt Cloud](https://cloud.tilt.dev/) are still very early in their product lifecycle. As such, Tilt's brand is still maturing. And so we're using this place to collect various brand elements as we grow.

## Name

Tilt Cloud is two words, not one CamelCase word. One word CamelCase is more prevalent when the second word isn't descriptive, like GitHub or GitLab.

## Domain

We use `tilt.dev` since we think [`.dev` is better than `.io`](https://medium.com/windmill-engineering/dev-is-a-better-io-why-we-moved-to-tilt-dev-9fc8321693d3).

## Colors

See our [brand colors](https://github.com/windmilleng/tilt/blob/master/web/src/constants.scss#L22).
