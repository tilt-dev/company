# Retros

We have a retro at least once a month. The purpose of the retro is to improve how we work at Tilt. The retro topics include, but are not limited to:
- How we communicate and collaborate with each other
- How we work with customers
- How we design and implement products
- How we plan for the future
- How we work on internal systems

The planning meeting facilitator for a given month is responsible for scheduling and running a retro that month. The facilitator chooses the topic(s)/meeting format.
