# Social Rules

We have a small set of [social
rules](https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules) lifted from the
[Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/). These rules are intended to be
lightweight, and to make more explicit certain social norms that are normally
implicit.

We expect people to unintentionally break the social rules from time to
time. Doing this doesn't make you a bad person or a bad tilter. When this
happens, it's not a big deal. Just apologize and move on. (Likewise, callouts
should be gentle and give the benefit of the doubt; we all mess up sometimes.)

## Code of Conduct

Tilt has a [Code of Conduct](https://docs.tilt.dev/code_of_conduct) that applies
to external spaces, such as GitHub, conferences, meetups, and support channels.
